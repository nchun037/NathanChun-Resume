        <p class="lead mb-4">I started my career working a gig job for a grocery delivery company called Instacart. The job mainly consisted of going to many different supermakets and grocery stores, buying the items that the customer requested for, and delivering it to their home. I started this job over quarantine as groceries were crucial at this period of time. Since it was a gig job, I was able to work at my own time which I really enjoyed but there was no base pay as my salary was dependent on the amount of orders I did. Driving around was also costly due to gas but the company recently added a policy where each worker gets compensated a certain amount for the distance they travelled while working.<br><br>

        I eventually slowed down with Instacart as the orders were too low and the time was not worth it after a while. As orders slowed down, the amouny of money I recieved from each order also dropped which caused me to drastically slow down on work. It instead became a job I did once in a while when I had free time to make money. I was considering continuing with grocery delivery when moving to Riverside for college but I have noticed that the orders were a lot less compared to where I lived previously. This caused me to quit Instacart completely and look for a new job.<br><br>

        Now it is 2022 and I recently got accepted to a job at Tilly's which is a clothing store. This is my first time working retail and it is very interesting to say the least. I started very recently so my knowledge about this job and retail in general is low. The upside is, that I now have a base salary and pay per hour worked which means I am guaranteed hours of work throughout the week. This is a step up from the gig job I previously had but the pay is lower but more stable. This is now my new part time job and I have no desire to switch or move at this moment in time when other factors are taken into consideration.
